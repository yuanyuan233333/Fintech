Description : 'Using a dataset containing financial data of borrower companies, 
we define a metric that provides the relative distance between companies by applying 
the standardized Euclidean distance between each pair of institutions feature vectors. 
The fully-connected nature of this set does not help to find out whether there exist 
dominant patterns of similarities between institutions. Therefore, the extraction of 
such relevant patterns demands a representation of the system where sparseness replaces 
completeness in a suitable way. To accomplish this purpose, we derive the Minimal Spanning 
Tree representation of borrowing companies finanical similarities. Finally, we test whether 
the inclusion of topological information regarding similarity patterns among companies feature, 
increases the forecasting performance of various credit scoring models.'
